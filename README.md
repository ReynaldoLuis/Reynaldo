# esp8266_tpm2net
esp8266_tpm2net is a custom firmware for the esp8266 wifi module that will drive a strand of addressable RGB LED pixels using the TPM2NET protocol.  We are planning support for the following chipsets ... as well as a tpm2net to tpm2ser gateway for use with other MCUs (arduino, stm32f1, ect.) connected via the UART.

#Planned Supported Chipsets
WS2801, WS2811, WS2812, LPD6803, LPD8803, LPD8806, LPD8809, APA102, APA104, PCA9685, TLC5940, ...
