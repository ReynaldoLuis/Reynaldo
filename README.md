# esp8266_tpm2net_ws2812
This is a custom firmware for the esp8266 wifi module that will drive a strand of ws2812 LEDs using the TPM2NET protocol. I was successful at driving 132 LEDs (11x12 matrix) using this firmware and the pixelcontroller (v2.1.0-RC1) software. I expect it to operate more LEDs (hopefully up to 512 LEDs) ...
